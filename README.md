# Javascript Algorithms Explanation

This repo is a set of most popular algorithms in Javascript. I will try to explain them in a simple way. In this repo you should can see the most popular sorting algorithms and searching algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms

The sorting algorithms will have in this repos are:

- [Bubble Sort](./sorting/bubble-sort/)
- [Merge Sort](./sorting/merge-sort/)
- [Quick Sort](./sorting/quick-sort/)
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Heap Sort

## Searching Algorithms

The searching algorithms will have in this repos are:

- Binary Search
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
