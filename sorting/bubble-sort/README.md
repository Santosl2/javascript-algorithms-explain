# Bubble Sort

The bubble sort is a sorting algorithm. It is named for the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list. It is one of the simplest sorting algorithms.

## Algorithm

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Compare the first two elements. If the first is greater than the second, swap them.
2. Compare the second and third elements. If the second is greater than the third, swap them.
3. Continue doing this for each pair of adjacent elements to the end of the array.
4. If elements have been swapped in the last step, repeat from step 1.

## Problem

Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the array.
